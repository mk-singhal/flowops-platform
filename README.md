# FlowOps 🚀

FlowOps is an event-driven operations platform designed to demonstrate
modern distributed system architecture using microservices, message
streaming, caching, and containerization.

The platform provides an enterprise-style admin dashboard to manage
orders and inventory, powered by Kafka-based asynchronous workflows
and Redis-backed caching for high-performance reads.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Material UI
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- Caching: Redis
- Database: MongoDB
- Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana (planned)

## Core Concepts Demonstrated
- Event-driven microservices
- Asynchronous communication using Kafka
- Redis caching and distributed locks
- Server-side pagination and data-heavy dashboards
- Dockerized frontend and backend services
